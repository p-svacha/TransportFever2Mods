result.layers:Distance: Apply this to a mask. Every point will receive the distance from the edge of the mask as its value.
result.layers.Map: Map the values of a map from a range to another range. If the last param is true, the values that were outside from the initial range are set to the limits of the new range 

bounds go from - realSize / 2 to realSize / 2 (used by rivers)
mapSize is realSize / 4 (used by noise)

area: 12km x 12km
mapSize: 1000/2500
bounds: -2000/5500


Mods to make:

Terrain Generator:
-------------------
todo:

- Forced Plains / Flat Land (check smoothen terrain from tropical ext)
- High Plateau / High Area of map (veeery big scale noise with high elevation, similar to mesa but with much higher linear blending, maybe double mask it so it doesn't appear to often)
- crater (random holes maybe?, should be rare)
- trench (overwrite lowland snake with steep blending, maybe double mask it so it doesnt cover whole map)
- stalagmites (rare small points with big elevation added to heightmap, can also appear in water!)
- underwater noise maybe?

-Assets:
forests
 - big and small
 - different trees
rocks

- check different map sizes
 - make rivers and lakes adjust to size
 - make amount of stalagmites adjust
