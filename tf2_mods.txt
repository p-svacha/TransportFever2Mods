USEFUL COMMANDS FOR TERRAIN GEN:
----------------
result.layers:Distance: Apply this to a mask. Every point will receive the distance from the edge of the mask as its value.
result.layers.Map: Map the values of a map from a range to another range. If the last param is true, the values that were outside from the initial range are set to the limits of the new range 
Herp: Converts linear to smooth interpolation
Exlerp: Converts linear to exponentail interpolation
Grad: (last param = 2): Returns the first derivative of a map, meaning the steepness of each point
Laplace: Returns the second derivative of a map, meaning highlighting the edges (not that useful)
Percolation: Flood fills a white noise map

MAP SIZES:
------------------------------
For TerrainGen:
bounds go from - realSize / 2 to realSize / 2 (used by rivers)
mapSize is realSize / 4 (used by noise)
area: 12km x 12km
mapSize: [0 - 3000] (used by noise)
bounds: [-6000 - 6000] (used by river generation)

At Runtime:
area: 4km x 4km => 
api.engine.getComponent(api.engine.util.getWorld(),
api.type.ComponentType.TERRAIN).size = 16 / 16 => 
units [-2000 - 2000]

MODELS:
------------------------------------------
Vehicle models: D:\Steam\steamapps\common\Transport Fever 2\res\textures\models\vehicle

Mission allow vehicles:

local vehiclestore = require "mission.vehiclestore"
vehiclestore.setAllowedVehicleCount("vehicle/plane/bleriot_xi.mdl", 1)

MOUSE:
-------------------
api.gui.util.getMouseScreenPos() or game.gui.getMousePos() - 
returns 2D screen coordinates for the user's "cursor", like "{ 987, 700, }"

api.gui.util.getGameUI():getTerrainPos() or game.gui.getTerrainPos() - 
returns the 3D world coordinates corresponding to the user's screen cursor, like "{ -3731.9204101563, 5461.7333984375, 19.83162689209, }"

MOD IDEAS:
------------------------------
Hamlets:
	- try building monuments with game.interface.buildConstruction(fileName, param, transf)

Geoguessr mod:
- change structure cameras to use "cameraController:follow(-1, false)" and "setCameraPosition" instead of follow
- rework toggle icon to open/close window
- prepare workshop stuff (thumbnail, tags, in-game thumbnail, description, in-game description, screenshots)
cameras to add:
town as a whole


Snowball's Distance meter - update to work with new version

Combined Climate: New climate that uses all textures and assets
