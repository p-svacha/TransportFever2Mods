See your world from new perspectives.

[h1]Geoguessr Cameras[/h1]
This mods adds new camera tools to the game. Inspired by the likes of Geoguessr or randomstreetview.com, these new camera tools will bring you to a random point on the map of some sorts. There are many different modes implemented, for example you can follow a random person, or jump to a random industry, or jump to a fully random position anywhere on the map. And that is all this mod does, it provides tools to move the camera. Nothing more, nothing less.

[h1]Features / Modes[/h1]
There are a total of 15 different camera modes implemented, organized into 5 categores:

[b]Street View[/b]
Your classic Geoguessr experience. Chosing a mode in this category will instantly move the camera to a any random street or rail track on your map and show it from a street view / first-person perspective. Due to camera limitations tunnels are excluded from this.
The available modes in this category are "Any Path", "Streets" and "Rail Tracks".

[b]Vehicles[/b]
Camera modes in this category will instantly move the camera to follow a random transport vehicle on the map. Note that private cars are not considered transport vehicles.
The available modes in this category are "Any vehicle", "Train", "Road Vehicle", "Ship" and "Plane".

[b]Creatures[/b]
With modes in this category you can follow a random living thing.
The available modes in this category are "Person" and "Animal".
Note that for people, only those are considered that are currently travelling. This includes people walking, waiting at stations and driving with private cars.

[b]Structures[/b]
Camera modes in this category will instantly move the camera to show a random structure/building of the chosen type.
The available modes in this category are "Town Building", "Industry" and "Station".

[b]Misc[/b]
This category contains two special camera modes.
The first one "Any Position" will instantly move the camera to show any random position on the map. This can be the center of a city, but will more likely be some random landscape or lake somewhere.
The second one "Anything" will randomly choose any of the other available options.

[h1]How to Use[/h1]
If you enable the mod you will see a new icon with a camera appear next to the "Bulldoze" icon. Clicking it will toggle a window with all the functions. Clicking on a button in that window will do the magic.

[h1]Why?[/h1]
I made this mod mostly for myself. I love just watching my worlds, and with these modes watching gets even more fun since you'll get to see it from many new perspectives you might have missed otherwise.
Or you can test how well you know your map. Do you recognize all the places the camera jumps to?
It's just a fun little tool and since I made it anyway, I might as well share it here. If you have any ideas for additional features just let me know in the comments, I always read them. :)
